# DarkMatterResearch

This program is used to create false ellipses in images to further the research of macro dark matter particles in granite slabs. When an image of a granite slab is input into the program, it cuts the image into 4 tiles using image_slicer. Draws a black ellipse about the size of the granite grain in the image in a random location with a random angle.
